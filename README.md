# elm-hangman
A simle version of Hangman, implemented in Elm.
Live demo [here](https://runarfu.github.io/elm-hangman/).
Don't look in `src/Secrets.elm` if you want to play the game first.
Drawings by [Henrik Hedlund](https://github.com/hedlund).

The code is supposed to be simple enough for Elm beginners to understand it.
Any feedback or pull requests are most welcome.
